## Why data cleaning matters?

Data cleaning helps ensure your results are based on valid, high-quality responses. ReDem automates this process to help you detect and exclude unreliable data.

ReDem’s data cleaning feature automates and streamlines this process, providing a standardized and transparent approach grounded in ReDem’s comprehensive evaluation framework.

## How Cleaning Works

Every respondent evaluated by ReDem goes through a series of quality checks. These checks produce scores and classification labels, which form the basis of the cleaning logic.

ReDem offers two cleaning approaches:

### 1. ReDem Recommended Cleaning Settings

Our default settings apply best-practice thresholds to the following metrics:


- **ReDem Score (R-Score)**: Respondents with an R-Score below 60 are excluded.
- **Open-Ended Score (OES) & Response Categories:**
  Respondents with an OES below 40 are excluded if they provide at least two open-ended responses.

  Respondents flagged in at least two open-ended responses for wrong language, bad language, AI generated Answer, nonsense or wrong topic are excluded.
- **Coherence Score (CHS)**: Respondents with a CHS below 30 are excluded.
- **Grid-Question Score (GQS)**: Respondents with a GQS below 20 and at least two valid grid-question responses are excluded.
- **Time Score (TS)**: Respondents with a TS below 20 are excluded.
- **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)**: Respondents with a BAS below 20 and at least two valid BAS data points are excluded.

### 2. Custom Cleaning Settings

You can define your own thresholds for each quality metric. This enables fine-tuned control over what qualifies as low-quality data based on your specific needs.

Customizable elements include:

- **ReDem Score (R-Score):** Threshold
- **Open-Ended Score (OES):** Threshold + min. number of open-ended responses + category-based exclusion logic
  - **Open-Ended Response Categories:**
    - **Generic Answer:**
    - **Bad Language:**
    - **No Information:**
    - **Duplicate Respondent:**
    - **Duplicate Answer:**
    - **Nonsense:**
    - **Wrong Language:**
    - **Wrong Topic:**
    - **AI Generated Answer:**
- **Time Score (TS):** Threshold + min. number of time data points
- **Grid-Question Score (GQS):** Threshold + min. valid grid questions
- **Coherence Score (CHS):** Threshold + min. number of coherence data points
- **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS):** Threshold + min. valid BAS data points + category-based exclusion logic
  - **BAS Categories:**
    - **Unnatural Typing:**
    - **Copy and Paste:**


Here’s an example of a cleaning settings object that can be used to customize the cleaning process via the API:

```javascript
  "redemScore": 60,
  "OES": {
    "activate": true,
    "score": 60,
    "minDataPoints":2,
    "categories": {
      "GENERIC_ANSWER": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
      "NO_INFORMATION": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":3},
      // ... other categories ...
    }
  },
  "CHS": {"activate": true,"score": 50},
  "GQS": {"activate": true,"score": 40, "minDataPoints":2},
  "TS": {"activate": true,"score": 20},
  "BAS": {
    "activate": true,
    "score": 60, 
    "minDataPoints":2,
    "categories": {
      "UNNATURAL_TYPING": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
      "COPY_AND_PASTE": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
    }
  }
```

## What Is the Outcome of the Cleaning Process?

Each respondent is classified as either:
- **Included**
- **Excluded**

Reasons for exclusion are clearly documented and based on whether any of the active criteria are triggered. Only one exclusion condition needs to be met for a respondent to be removed.

- ReDem Score below threshold
- Open-Ended Score below threshold
- Open-Ended categories exceed allowed count
- Time Score below threshold
- Grid-Question Score below threshold
- Coherence Score below threshold
- Behavioral Analytics Score below threshold
- BAS categories (e.g. Copy-Paste, Unnatural Typing) exceed allowed count

This transparent system ensures your data cleaning is auditable, adjustable, and aligned with your quality requirements.

## Example Case: Cleaning in Practice

Here’s a sample configuration and its impact on a respondent:

```javascript
  "redemScore": 60,
  "OES": {
    "activate": true,
    "score": 60,
    "minDataPoints":2,
    "categories": {
      "GENERIC_ANSWER": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
      "NO_INFORMATION": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
      "BAD_LANGUAGE": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "NONSENSE": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "DUPLICATE_ANSWER": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "DUPLICATE_RESPONDENT": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "WRONG_TOPIC": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "WRONG_LANGUAGE": {"activate": false, "minDataPoints":2},
      "AI_GENERATED_ANSWER": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":1}
    }
  }
```

This configuration will exclude a respondent who:
- Scores < 60 on the ReDem Score
- Has 2+ generic answers
- Has 2+ “No Information” responses
- Or even just 1 flagged AI-generated response (due to its lower tolerance threshold)
