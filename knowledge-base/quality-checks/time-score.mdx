## What is the Time Score?

The Time Score allows you to evaluate how much time respondents spend on different parts of the questionnaire—such as the total interview duration, time per section, or time per question. It flags responses that significantly deviate from time patterns of other respondents, helping you detect rushed or overly slow behavior.

By identifying these anomalies, the Time Score helps improve the overall reliability of your survey data.

## High-level checks performed 
- The total length of interview (LOI, “length of interview”) is compared with a benchmark or median for the study or subgroup.
- Optional durations for individual questions or sections may also be evaluated if available.

<Note> **Important:** Scores are only calculated when there are at least 30 respondents, ensuring the median is statistically meaningful.</Note>

## Total Time Score Calculation per Respondent

Time Scores are calculated for each available time metric (e.g., LOI, time per page), then combined into an overall score for the respondent.

To ensure accurate scoring, we recommend capturing the time spent per page. This allows for a more detailed and precise assessment of respondent engagement.
