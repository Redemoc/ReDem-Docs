## What is the Time Score?

The Time Score allows you to evaluate how much time respondents spend on different parts of the questionnaire—such as the total interview duration, time per section, or time per question. It flags responses that significantly deviate from expected time patterns, helping you detect rushed or overly slow behavior.

By identifying these anomalies, the Time Score helps improve the overall reliability of your survey data.

## How Individual Time Scores Are Calculated

Each time-based score is calculated by comparing a respondent’s duration to the median time of other participants.

Scoring rules:

* **Less than 10% of the median**: Score = `0`

* **Between 10% and 50% of the median**: Score = `0-50`

* **Between 50%–80% or 400%–1000% of the median**: Score = `50-80`

* **Between 80% and 400% of the median**: Score = `80-100`

<Note> **Important:** Scores are only calculated when there are at least 30 respondents, ensuring the median is statistically meaningful.</Note>

## Total Time Score Calculation per Respondent

Time Scores are calculated for each available time metric (e.g., LOI, time per page), then combined into an overall score for the respondent.

To ensure accurate scoring, we recommend capturing the time spent per page. This allows for a more detailed and precise assessment of respondent engagement.
