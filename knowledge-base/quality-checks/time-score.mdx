## What is the Time Score?

ReDem enables you to assess respondents based on the time they spend on any part of a questionnaire, such as total duration, time per section, or time per question. This feature flags responses that deviate from expected time norms, helping you identify and address inconsistencies in respondent engagement.

Whether a participant rushes through or takes longer than anticipated, the Time Score highlights potential issues, enhancing the overall quality of your survey data.

## Calculation of Individual Time Scores for Each Time Duration

We assess questionnaire response times by comparing a respondent's duration to the median time of other participants.

Time-Scores are calculated as follows:

* **Less than 10% of the median**: Score = `0`

* **Between 10% and 50% of the median**: Score = `0-50`

* **Between 50% to 80%  and between 400% to 1000% of the median**: Score = `50-80`

* **Between 80% and 400% of the median**: Score = `80-100`

<Note> **Important:** Time Scores are calculated only when the sample size reaches at least 30, ensuring the median respondent duration is statistically meaningful.</Note>

## Calculation of the Total Time Score for a Respondent

Time Scores are calculated individually for each specific part of the questionnaire and then combined into an overall score.

To maximize the score's accuracy and relevance, we recommend including not only the total interview duration (LOI) but also detailed timing data for as many individual sections of the interview as possible. This approach provides a clearer and more precise understanding of respondent engagement.
