## What is the Open-Ended Score?

Open-ended quality checks evaluate free-text responses for relevance, informativeness, language conformity, duplication, and potential synthetic (automated) generation. The goal is to ensure that collected open-ended answers are meaningful and usable for analysis.

## High-level checks performed

The following is a conceptual (non-exhaustive) list of the kinds of checks applied to open-ended responses:

- Topicality / Relevance: Does the response generally address the question asked?


- Informativeness: Does the response add substantive content (details, examples, clarifying facts) rather than being overly short or generic?


- Language conformity: Is the response in the expected language and free from abuse (as defined by your project’s policy)?


- Duplication / Redundancy: Does the response appear identical or highly similar to other responses from the same respondent or across recent data?


- Synthetic generation indicators: Automated methods evaluate linguistic and, when available, behavioral signals to detect patterns commonly associated with synthetic (machine-generated) text.


## Use of GPT for Open-Ended Score

ReDem uses the most advanced GPT large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, to analyze and categorize open-ended responses. This enables precise and reliable scoring by leveraging cutting-edge language understanding.

To ensure data privacy and compliance, GPT is integrated into the ReDem OES with strict safeguards:

### Individual Responses & Anonymity

Each response is sent to OpenAI individually, using a fully anonymized ID. Only the single response is transmitted per API request—complete survey datasets are never shared.

### Exclusive Use by ReDem

Only ReDem communicates with OpenAI. The platform does not share any details about the origin or source of the responses.

### Data Storage & Retention

OpenAI retains data for up to 30 days, after which it is permanently deleted. The data is never used to train AI models.

### GDPR-Compliant Data Transfers

ReDem and OpenAI operate under a Data Processing Agreement based on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). This ensures all data transfers—including those involving personal data—fully comply with GDPR

This setup gives you both the advanced capabilities of GPT and the data protection required for responsible AI use in survey research.
