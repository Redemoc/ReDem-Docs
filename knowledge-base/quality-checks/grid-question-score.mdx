## What is the Grid-Question Score?

The GQS helps assess data quality in grid questions (also known as matrix questions). It uses machine learning and a defined set of pattern-detection rules to evaluate how respondents interact with grid items.

## How is the Grid-Question Score calculated?

Each grid question is scored individually based on the respondent’s answer pattern. The system compares these patterns to known low-quality behaviors, such as:
- Straightlining (selecting the same option across all items)
- Zigzagging (alternating responses in a mechanical or patterned way)

The more closely a respondent’s answers match these behaviors, the lower their score. All individual grid scores are then aggregated into one overall GQS per respondent.

<Note>
  To detect response patterns beyond straightlining, grid question data must be submitted to the API in the original display order shown to the respondent.
