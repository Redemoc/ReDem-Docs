## What is the Grid-Question Score?

The GQS helps assess data quality in grid questions (also known as matrix questions). It uses machine learning and a defined set of pattern-detection rules to evaluate how respondents interact with grid items.

## High-level checks performed 
- Whether the sequence of responses across the grid items shows minimal variance, e.g., always choosing the same option across many rows (straight-lining).
- Whether the ordering of responses is highly repetitive or patterned (e.g., always lowest → highest → lowest → highest) when that would not make sense for the item content.
- Whether at least a minimum number of items are present in the grid (public recommendation: 7 items or more) so that pattern checks are meaningful.

<Note>
  To detect response patterns beyond straightlining, grid question data must be submitted to the API in the original display order shown to the respondent.

## What Patterns Does the GQS Detect?

ReDem currently analyzes the following behavioral patterns in grid responses:
