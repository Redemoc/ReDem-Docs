## What is the Grid-Question Score?

The GQS helps assess data quality in grid questions (also known as matrix questions). It uses machine learning and a defined set of pattern-detection rules to evaluate how respondents interact with grid items.

## How is the Grid-Question Score calculated?

Each grid question is scored individually based on the respondent’s answer sequence. We compare that sequence to known low-quality response patterns; the closer the match, the lower the grid’s score. Finally, all grid-level scores are combined into one overall GQS per respondent.

**Low-quality patterns we detect:**
- **Straightlining** <br/> Selecting the same option across all items. Labeled “Straightliner.”
- **Partial Straightlining** <br/> Mostly the same option with only a few switches between adjacent items. If fewer than 35% of adjacent transitions are changes, we label it “Partial Straightliner.”
- **Pattern clicking** <br/>Mechanical rhythms that ignore item content, e.g. alternating (1-2-1-2…), stair-stepping (1-2-3-4…), zig-zag/mirrored patterns (1-2-3-2-1…), or repeating cycles. The more regular and repeated the pattern, the lower the score.

<Note>
  To detect response patterns beyond straightlining, grid question data must be submitted to the API in the original display order shown to the respondent.
