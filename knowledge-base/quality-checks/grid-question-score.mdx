## What is the Grid-Question Score?

ReDem simplifies the evaluation of grid questions with the Grid-Question Score (GQS). This innovative metric leverages machine learning and a unique set of checks to analyze respondent behavior and detect patterns in matrix-style answers.

## How is the Grid-Question Score calculated?

We analyze responses to identify patterns and detect poor respondent behavior. The closer a respondent's answer pattern aligns with recognized "bad" patterns—like straightlining (selecting the same option across all grid items) or zigzagging—the lower their score. Each grid question is scored individually, and these scores are aggregated into an overall performance score.

<Note>
  Response patterns (excluding straightlining) can only be detected if ReDem is used in real-time via our API, through survey software with integrated ReDem functionalities, or if items are imported in the exact order they were presented to respondents.

## What patterns does the Grid-Question Score check for?

We currently focus on analyzing specific response patterns to assess respondent behavior. Key patterns include:
