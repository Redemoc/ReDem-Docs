## Comprehensive Quality Evaluation

The ReDem Total Quality Score (R-Score) provides a multidimensional evaluation of data quality in open-ended and close-ended survey responses. Built on a 360-degree assessment framework, each respondent’s data is systematically analyzed across multiple quality dimensions.

## Objective and Transparent Scoring

The R-Score consolidates a broad range of quality indicators into a single, interpretable metric. This includes automated checks for inconsistencies, duplications, unnatural response patterns, language compliance, and other behavioral markers indicative of low-quality or fraudulent input.

## Robust Against Fraudulent Responses

By embedding quality control mechanisms throughout the survey process, ReDem ensures that data integrity is maintained at every step. This systematic approach minimizes the risk of undetected manipulation and provides researchers with a reliable basis for downstream analyses.

### The Subscores of the ReDem Score

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open-Ended Score" icon="messages" href="/quality-checks/open-ended-score">
    Evaluates the quality of open-ended answers using AI. It considers factors such as relevance, duplication, and potential AI generation to detect inattentive, generic, or fraudulent responses.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Coherence Score" icon="grid-2-plus" href="/quality-checks/coherence-score">
    Assesses the logical consistency and plausibility of a respondent’s answers across the entire interview. This score helps automatically identify contradictions and inconsistencies in response patterns.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Time Score" icon="stopwatch" href="/quality-checks/time-score">
    Analyzes total interview duration and time spent per question. It flags responses that are too fast, too slow, or show irregular timing patterns compared to the expected baseline.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Grid-Question Score" icon="list" href="/quality-checks/grid-question-score">
    Evaluates response behavior in grid questions. It detects different patterns, such as straight-lining or zigzag answering, using machine learning.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Behavioral Analytics Score" icon="keyboard" href="/quality-checks/behavior-analysis-score">
    Analyzes typing behavior to distinguish natural human input from potentially automated or artificial entries. It considers typing speed, rhythm, and variability to flag suspicious input patterns.
