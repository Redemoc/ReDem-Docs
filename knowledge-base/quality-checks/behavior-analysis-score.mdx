## What is the Behavioral Analytics Score?

The **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** measures the quality of typing behavior to distinguish between natural human input and potentially artificial or automated responses. It helps detect answers generated by AI bots, scripts, or copy-paste actions—enhancing the reliability and authenticity of survey data.

## How does the Behavioral Analytics Score work?

BAS analyzes each keystroke, the structure of the entered text, and the timing of inputs. It evaluates:

- Typing speed and rhythm
- Standard deviation of keystroke intervals
- Timing consistency relative to text structure
- Copy-paste actions (i.e., no keystroke activity)

These signals are combined to detect patterns that deviate from natural human typing.

### Typing Patterns

**Natural Human Typing** <br />
Character-by-character input with natural pauses, consistent rhythm, and normal variations—typical of genuine human behavior.

**Low-Effort Human Typing** <br />
Still human, but with less consistent or more erratic timing—often seen in low-effort responses.

**Auto-Complete Enhanced Typing** <br />
Combines typing with auto-complete suggestions. Detected by bursts of text insertion that still follow human-like patterns.

**Copy-Paste Typing** <br />
Text is inserted without keystrokes. This behavior bypasses typing rhythm entirely and is flagged as copy and paste event.

**Unnatural Typing** <br />
Shows irregular keystroke patterns, such as highly inconsistent timing, repetitive sequences, or unusually fast inputs that deviate from typical human behavior. These patterns may indicate automated responses, AI-assisted typing, or scripted entries—making them strong indicators of non-human activity.

## BAS Classification System

ReDem uses **AI and proprietary algorithms** to assign each response to one of the following categories:

- **Natural** – Genuine human input
- **Unnatural**: Potential automation, AI typing, or scripting
- **Copy-paste**: No natural typing activity detected

### Scoring system

BAS produces a score from 0 to 100:

- **> 50** → Indicates natural or human-like typing
- **< 50** → Suggests unnatural or potentially automated input
- **0** → Assigned when copy-paste behavior is detected
