## What is the Behavioral Analytics Score?

The **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** measures the quality of typing behavior to distinguish between natural human input and potentially artificial or automated responses. It helps detect answers generated by AI bots, scripts, or copy-paste actions—enhancing the reliability and authenticity of survey data.

## High-level checks performed
- Checks for unusually fast typing that is inconsistent with manual human input.
- Checks for copy-&-paste patterns (e.g., large blocks inserted with minimal keystroke events).
- Checks for highly uniform or repetitive keystroke rhythms that differ from typical human variation.
- Where instrumented, checks for behaviour metadata (e.g., pause durations between keystrokes, editing patterns) that deviate from expected human behaviour.


## How to use BAS?

BAS is designed to be used in real-time, via our API, or through survey software with integrated ReDem functionalities.
