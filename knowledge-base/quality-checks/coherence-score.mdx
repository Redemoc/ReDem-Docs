The coherence score is an AI-driven metric that evaluates the plausibility and logical consistency of responses throughout an entire interview, from screening questions to socio-demographics. This highly robust quality check detects contradictions and inconsistencies, making manipulation nearly impossible. Unlike traditional trap questions—which fraudsters and AI bots can easily identify—the Coherence Score is a game-changer in fraud detection. It works seamlessly within regular questionnaires, identifying inconsistencies without relying on special questions. For example, it can flag contradictions, like a respondent claiming regular subway use while living in a city without one.

Additionally, the Coherence Score minimizes false positives by avoiding the disqualification of respondents who may have misclicked or momentarily lost focus but otherwise performed acceptably. This approach not only enhances fraud detection but also ensures more accurate and fair assessments.

## High-level checks performed 

This check looks at, for example:
- Whether answers that should logically align (e.g., travel mode, days stayed, budget) are consistent with one another.
- Whether the pattern and combination of responses across different questions fit a plausible scenario.
- Whether any answers appear contradictory (for example: “I never use the app” in one section and “I use it weekly” in another).
- These checks are intended to flag inconsistent or implausible response sets.

## What the Coherence Score Includes:
- Explanation of the Rating: Provides a summary of the overall quality of the interview.
- Describes how consistent or contradictory the respondent’s answers are across questions.
- Highlights key factors that influenced the rating (e.g. logical flow, alignment of answers).
- List of Incoherent Questions: Identifies specific questions where the respondent’s answers were inconsistent or contradictory.
- Points out answers that conflict with earlier responses or are implausible in the context of the interview.
- Offers valuable insights into areas of potential concern, helping to flag data reliability issues.
