ReDem‚Äôs advanced quality checks work best when your questionnaire is strategically structured. Below are best practices for designing surveys that unlock the full power of ReDem‚Äôs quality scores.

### Open-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions are highly effective for quality assurance and fraud detection. We recommend including at least two mandatory open-ended questions in every survey.

ü§î **Why they matter:**

- **Mandatory answers filter out fraudsters:** Fraudsters and disengaged respondents often skip or give meaningless answers to open-ended questions. Making them mandatory helps eliminate them early.
- **AI-evaluable content:** Avoid generic questions like ‚ÄúAnything else you‚Äôd like to share?‚Äù Instead, ask questions that provide context, enabling ReDem‚Äôs AI to evaluate response quality.
- **Detecting AI-generated content:** Emotional or opinion-based questions are especially helpful, as AI systems often struggle to convincingly express authentic emotion or personal views.
- **Strategic placement:** Place one open-ended question at the beginning and one at the end. This helps evaluate attention and consistency across the interview.
- **Duplication detection:** ReDem checks for identical or similar open-ended responses both within and across interviews to flag suspicious patterns.

### Grid-Questions

Grid or matrix-style questions allow for pattern recognition in click behavior, helping detect inattentive or fraudulent respondents.

üëçüèº **Design recommendations:**

- Include at least 1 grid question with a minimum of 7 items and 4 or more response options (e.g., a Likert scale).
- Ensure enough variability: A higher number of statements helps differentiate meaningful from arbitrary responses.
- Balance options and items: More items = fewer needed options, but never fewer than 3.
- Add inverted statements: Mix positive and negative phrasing to reveal inconsistent or bot answer patterns (e.g., straightlining or zigzagging).

### Time Durations

ReDem‚Äôs Time Score is more accurate when detailed timing data is available.

ü§® **What to capture:**

- **Total Interview Duration (LOI)**: Used to flag unusually fast or slow respondents.
- **Section/Page-Specific Timing**: Helps identify suspicious timing behavior, especially in longer or complex sections or pages.
- **Avoid brief sections**: Skip timing for yes/no or demographic questions.
- **Account for interruptions**: Be aware of idle time manipulation by bots trying to simulate realistic durations.

### Trap Questions

Trap questions support the Coherence Score by identifying respondents who overclaim, contradict themselves, or fail attention checks.

‚úÖ **Best practices:**

- **Use Sparingly:** Limit to a maximum of two trap questions per survey to avoid participant frustration.
- **Design Subtly:** Don‚Äôt make trap questions obvious. If respondents detect them, they may adjust their answers unnaturally.
- **Mix formats:** Use variations like:
    - Repeat questions with rephrased wording
    - Instructions to select a specific option
    - Fake or nonsense options (e.g., fictional brands)
- **Design for contradiction detection:** Structure your questionnaire in a way that allows contradictions to emerge. This helps ReDem‚Äôs Coherence Score detect dishonest or inattentive respondents more effectively.
- **Don‚Äôt rely on traps alone:** Trap questions should complement, not replace, broader ReDem checks. An isolated error shouldn‚Äôt unfairly disqualify high-quality respondents.
