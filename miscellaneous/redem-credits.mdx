### ðŸ’¡Important Credit Rules

* **Grid-Question Score (GQS):** The maximum charge is capped at **3 credits per respondent**. Each grid-question item costs **0.1 credit**, but even if a respondent has numerous items, the total cost for GQS will not exceed 3 credits.

* **Time Score (TS):** The maximum cost is **1 credit per respondent**, regardless of the number of time-related data points included.

* **Coherence Score (CHS):** A maximum of **20 data points** is included in the base calculation, costing **3 credits** per respondent. For additional data points beyond 20, each incurs an extra cost of **0.2 credits**.

* **No Credits for Empty Answers or Missing Values:** Credits are only applied to valid, present data points. No credits are charged for empty responses or missing values.<br />
  No credits are calculated for empty answers or missing values within the data. Credits are only applied to valid, present data points.

* **Total Credit Calculation for Surveys**: The total cost of a survey is calculated by adding up the credit costs for all respondents. Each respondent's credit usage is determined by their individual data points and the quality checks applied.<br />
