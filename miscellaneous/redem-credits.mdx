## What are ReDem Credits?

ReDem Credits serve as the currency for paying for quality checks on your survey data. <br/>
You can acquire credits through individual annual plans. To learn more about available credit plans or to sign up for a new plan, [click here](https://redem.io/pricing/).

## Basics of ReDem Credits
To import data into ReDem, you need to spend ReDem credits. The credits required are based on the quality checks selected for each respondent. 
The minimum cost is **4 credits per respondent**, with the total potentially increasing depending on the quality parameters you choose to apply. 

This way, you have control over balancing cost and the level of data quality you want! 

## Calculation of ReDem Credits

The following list provides a clear overview of how credits are calculated based on Quality Scores. All calculations are performed on a per-respondent basis:

### ðŸ’¡Important Credit Rules
- **The maximum number of credits for the Grid-Question-Score (GQS) is 3 credits per respondent.** <br/>
Each grid-question item costs 0.1 credit. If a respondent has numerous grid-question items, the maximum charge per respondent for GQS remains capped at 3 credits.

- **The Maximum Number of Credits for Time-Score (TS) is 3 credits per respondent.** <br/>
No matter how many time-related data points are included for a respondent, the cost for TS will not exceed 1 credit.

- **The Maximum Number of Data Points Considered for Base Credits in Coherence-Score (CHS) is 20.** <br/>
If a respondent has 20 or fewer CHS data points, the cost is 2 credits. For additional data points beyond 20, each data point incurs an additional cost of 0.5 credits.

- **No Credits for Empty Answers or Missing Values** <br/>
No credits are calculated for empty answers or missing values within the data. Credits are only applied to valid, present data points.

- **Total Credit Calculation for Surveys** <br/>
The total cost for a survey is calculated by summing the credit cost for each respondent. Each respondentâ€™s credit requirements are determined based on their individual data points and applied quality checks.
