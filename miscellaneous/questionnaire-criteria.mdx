Improve fraud detection by strategically designing your questionnaires to maximize the effectiveness of ReDem’s advanced quality checks. If your questionnaire doesn’t meet these criteria, consider refining it for better results.

### Open-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions are highly effective for ensuring data quality. As described in detail below **we recommend including at least two mandatory open-ended questions** in every survey. These questions can serve purely as quality control measures and don’t necessarily need evaluation.

* **Mandatory:** Fraudsters often avoid answering open-ended questions if they can, and inattentive participants tend to skip them too. Therefore, making these questions mandatory is crucial. If designed appropriately (e.g., not too many or overly difficult questions), the dropouts caused by mandatory open-ended questions can actually improve data quality by filtering out disengaged participants.

* **AI-Friendly:** Open-ended questions should be well suited for AI-assisted quality checks. They need to provide a frame of reference for the AI to assess the meaningfulness of responses. Questions like "Would you like to tell us anything else?" are less effective because they lack a content framework, making it difficult for AI to evaluate answer quality.

* **Detecting AI-Generated Responses:** To identify AI-generated responses, questions that are emotional or opinion-based are particularly useful, as chatbots struggle to authentically replicate personal opinions or emotional expressions.

* **Strategic Placement:** For thorough quality assessment, it is recommended to include at least two open-ended questions in a questionnaire, strategically placed, such as one at the beginning and one at the end. In longer surveys, a respondent may momentarily lose focus and provide a nonsensical answer, but if this occurs more than once, it significantly increases the likelihood of poor data quality. This distribution also helps evaluate participant engagement throughout the survey. Additionally, analyzing duplicates or partial duplicates within a single interview, as well as across multiple interviews, can further aid in quality assessment.

### Grid-Questions

Grid questions provide a useful tool for in-survey quality checks by allowing the analysis of participant click behavior for signs of inattentiveness or fraud. As described in detail below **we recommend to include at least one grid question with at least seven items** (the more, the better) and in each case 4 or more attribute values (e.g., a Likert scale).

* **Sufficient Number of Statements:** To accurately determine whether responses are genuine or arbitrary, a grid question should include a sufficient number of statements. Our experience suggests a minimum of seven statements for this purpose.

* **Appropriate Number of Options:** The number of response options should be inversely related to the number of statements in the grid. As the number of statements increases, fewer options are needed. We recommend at least three options to ensure reliable quality checks.

* **Inverted Statements:** Statements should be phrased to create potential inconsistencies or contradictions if answered uniformly. This can be achieved by including both positive and negative statements about the subject being examined, ensuring that the responses require thoughtful consideration.

### Time Durations

To ensure the accuracy and relevance of timing-based quality checks, we recommend capturing not only the total interview duration (LOI) but also detailed timing data for individual sections of the survey. Fraudsters and bots often manipulate total duration by quickly completing the questionnaire and then idling until the total time appears realistic before closing the survey. Section-specific timing helps detect such behavior, providing a more reliable measure of engagement and authenticity.&#x20;

* **Total Interview Duration**: Measure the overall survey completion time to flag unusually fast or slow responses, which may indicate inattentiveness or fraud.&#x20;

* **Section-Specific Timing**: Focus on timing longer sections, such as matrix or multiple choice questions with substantial text or open-ended responses, to gain deeper insights into engagement levels.

* **Exclude Short Sections**: Avoid timing brief sections, like yes/no questions or demographic inquiries, as their duration offers little meaningful information.

* **Account for Interruptions**: Ensure that potential interruptions during survey completion do not interfere with accurate time tracking.

### Trap Questions

Adding trap questions to your survey is a powerful way to boost the effectiveness of ReDem's Coherence Score.  Trap questions can take various forms, such as differently worded repeat questions, prompts to select a specific answer option, or questions with nonsense or non-existing options. The latter, for example, can expose overclaiming, where respondents - often fraudsters - select as many options as possible to increase their chances of qualifying for the survey. The primary purpose of trap questions is to assess the quality of responses rather than to gather content for analysis. Careful implementation is essential. Consider the following:

* **Use Sparingly:** Incorporate only a maximum of two trap questions to avoid overwhelming or irritating participants.

* **Design Subtly:** Ensure that trap questions are not easily recognized as such to maintain their effectiveness, as revealing their intent could lead participants to adjust their responses to match the study's criteria.

* **Avoid Sole Reliance:** Use trap questions as part of ReDem's broader quality assurance strategy, rather than as the sole measure of interview quality. Overreliance could unfairly penalize careful participants who make an isolated error, leading to unnecessary exclusions and loss of earned incentives.
