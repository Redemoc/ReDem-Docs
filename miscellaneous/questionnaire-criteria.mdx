This guide explains how to design your questionnaire to enable ReDem to provide a comprehensive analysis of data quality. ReDem offers flexibility in applying quality checks, but meeting the minimum criteria outlined here is crucial for objective quality control.

If your questionnaire doesn’t meet these criteria, consider enhancing it for better results. Open-ended questions are particularly effective for ensuring data quality.

### Open-Ended Questions
- Include at least **2 mandatory open-ended questions** that all respondents must answer.
- Ideal questions are context-specific, like:
  - “What was your main reason for purchasing product XYZ?”
  - “Please describe your ideal summer vacation.”
- Avoid vague questions, such as “What else do you want to tell us?”
- Semi-open questions (e.g., brand names) are not suitable for quality checks due to limited response variety. Use these only when closed questions aren’t adequate, like “Which brands do you know in the XYZ category?”
- The open-ended questions can be added for quality control purposes only and do not need to be evaluated.

### Grid-Questions
- Include at least **1 grid question** with at least **7 items** (the more, the better) and in each case at least **4 attribute values** (e.g., a Likert scale).
- This format is especially valuable when contradictory responses reveal inconsistencies, like agreeing with stricter penalties for drink-driving but also favoring raising the blood alcohol limit.

### Time Durations
- Capture the **total interview duration** to identify unusually fast or slow responses.
- Consider measuring durations for specific sections (e.g., matrix questions with substantial text or open-ended responses) for more insight.
- Avoid timing short yes/no questions or demographic inquiries, as they are too brief for meaningful analysis.
- If interruptions are possible during survey completion, ensure they don’t interfere with time tracking.
