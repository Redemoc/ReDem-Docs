## Overview

Working with one of our integrated partners in the fastest path to using ReDem: 
you don’t need to upload surveys manually or build your own integration. 
Our partner handles the integration from within their platform. 
That way the setup time for you is effectively zero. 
You just activate ReDem in our partners platform and choose which questions to include in the ReDem analysis. 
Use this page to see how deep the integration with your platform is.
