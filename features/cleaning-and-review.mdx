## Why data cleaning matters?

Data cleaning is a critical step in ensuring the quality of your analysis. It not only identifies inconsistencies and irrelevant data but also plays a vital role in detecting low-quality respondents and artificially generated responses.

ReDem’s data cleaning feature automates and streamlines this process, providing a standardized and transparent approach grounded in ReDem’s comprehensive evaluation framework.

## How does cleaning work?

Every respondent evaluated by ReDem undergoes a series of rigorous quality checks. These checks assign a score and categorize each response, forming the foundation of ReDem’s data cleaning process.

ReDem offers two primary methods for cleaning your data::

### ReDem Default Cleaning Settings

Built on ReDem’s expertise, our default cleaning settings effectively address the most common data quality issues.

**Overview of Default Settings:**
An interview is flagged for exclusion if **any** of the following criteria are met:

* **ReDem Score \< 60**: Interviews scoring below 60 are flagged.

* **Open-Ended Score (OES) \< 30**: Interviews with an OES below 30 are flagged.

* **Time Score (TS) \< 20**: Interviews with a TS below 20 are flagged.

### Using Custom Cleaning Settings

To customize the cleaning process, you can create your own custom cleaning settings by defining specific thresholds for each quality check. This allows you to tailor the cleaning criteria to suit your unique requirements, ensuring more precise and relevant results.

**Open-Ended Response Categories**: <br /> Each category below outlines the criteria for flagging respondents based on their open-ended responses. Respondents are flagged as excluded if their responses meet the respective conditions.

* **Generic Answer**: <br /> The respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses classified as generic.

* **No Information**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as no information.

* **Bad Language**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as bad language.

* **Nonsense**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as nonsense.

* **Duplicate Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as duplicate answer.

* **Duplicate Respondent**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as duplicate respondent.

* **Wrong Topic**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as wrong topic.

* **Wrong Language**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as wrong language.

* **Copy-Paste Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as copy-paste answer.

* **Fake Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **one or more** open-ended responses that classified as fake answer.

## What is the outcome of the cleaning process?

The cleaning process classifies each response as either **Included** or **Excluded**, with clear reasons provided for exclusions. This ensures transparency and highlights areas that may require further attention or adjustments.

**Reasons for Exclusion** (only one needs to be true):

* **ReDem Score Threshold**: Respondent’s ReDem Score is below the default (60) or a custom threshold.

* **Open-Ended Score (OES) Threshold**: Respondent’s OES is below the default (30) or a custom threshold.

* **Time Score (TS) Threshold**: Respondent’s TS is below the default (20) or a custom threshold.

* **Grid-Question Score (GQS) Threshold**: Respondent’s GQS is below a custom threshold.

* **Coherence Score (CHS) Threshold**: Respondent’s CHS is below a custom threshold.

This structured reasoning provides clear insights into exclusions, empowering users to refine their criteria based on the analysis.
