## Why data cleaning matters?

Data cleaning is a critical step in ensuring the quality of your analysis. It not only identifies inconsistencies and irrelevant data but also plays a vital role in detecting low-quality respondents and artificially generated responses.

ReDem’s data cleaning feature automates and streamlines this process, providing a standardized and transparent approach grounded in ReDem’s comprehensive evaluation framework.

## How does cleaning work?

Every respondent evaluated by ReDem undergoes a series of rigorous quality checks. These checks assign a score and categorize each response, forming the foundation of ReDem’s data cleaning process.

ReDem offers two primary methods for cleaning your data::

### Using ReDem Default Cleaning Settings

Leveraging the ReDem team’s expertise and comprehensive quality checks, we’ve developed default cleaning settings tailored to address the most common scenarios.

Here’s a summary of the default settings:

**ReDem Score**: `60` <br /> Respondent with a **ReDem score below 60** are flagged as excluded.

**Open-Ended Score (OES)** - `60` <br /> Applies if a respondent **OES score is below 60 and provides at least two valid open-ended responses** are flagged as excluded.

**Open-Ended Response Categories**: <br /> Each category below outlines the criteria for flagging respondents based on their open-ended responses. Respondents are flagged as excluded if their responses meet the respective conditions.

* **Generic Answer**: <br /> The respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses classified as generic.

* **No Information**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as no information.

* **Bad Language**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as bad language.

* **Nonsense**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as nonsense.

* **Duplicate Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as duplicate answer.

* **Duplicate Respondent**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as duplicate respondent.

* **Wrong Topic**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as wrong topic.

* **Wrong Language**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as wrong language.

* **Copy-Paste Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **two or more** open-ended responses that classified as copy-paste answer.

* **Fake Answer**: <br /> If respondent has **one or more** open-ended responses that classified as fake answer.

**Coherence Score (CHS)**: `50` <br /> Applies if a respondent **CHS score is below 50** are flagged as excluded.

**Grid-Question Score (GQS)**: `40` <br /> Applies if a respondent **GQS score is below 40 and has at least two valid grid-question data points** are flagged as excluded.

**Time Score (TS)**: `20` <br /> Applies if a respondent **TS score is below 20** are flagged as excluded.

### Using Custom Cleaning Settings

To customize the cleaning process, you can create your own custom cleaning settings by defining specific thresholds for each quality check. This allows you to tailor the cleaning criteria to suit your unique requirements, ensuring more precise and relevant results.

## What is the outcome of the cleaning process?

The cleaning process categorizes each response as either `Included` or `Excluded`, with clear reasons provided for any exclusions. This ensures transparency and helps identify areas that may need further attention or adjustments.

Set of Reasons for Exclusion:

* `ReDem Score Threshold`: The respondent's ReDem score is below than default threshold.

* `Open-Ended Score Threshold`: The respondent's OES score is below than default threshold.

* `Open-Ended Category`: The respondent's responses meet the criteria for one or more of the Open-ended answer categories.

* `Coherence Score Threshold`: The respondent's CHS score is below than default threshold.

* `Grid-Question Score Threshold`: The respondent's GQS score is below than default threshold.

* `Time Score Threshold`: The respondent's TS score is below than default threshold.

This structured reasoning provides clarity on exclusions and enables users to refine their criteria based on the analysis.
