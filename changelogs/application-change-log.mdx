<Update label="2026-02-26" description="v1.4.8">
  ## File Import
  - The upload of respondents is noticeably faster, such that results are available much earlier.
  - We improved the import process for Decipher files. The import is now more reliable and configuring the survey is way faster than before.
  - In case a file contains duplicate respondent IDs, the import will now point to the exact IDs that are duplicates.
  ## Support for tracking surveys
  - When uploading a new survey, you can now choose to use the quality checks and cleaning settings from a previous one. This makes the import of recurring surveys much smoother and less error prone.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-02-24" description="v1.4.7">
  ## Admin Permissions
  - Company Admins can now exclude, recalculate and delete respondents for other employess in the company. They also can add additional respondents and delete surveys.
  ## CHS
  - The CHS now accepts only up to 300 questions per respondent. We observed decreased accuracy of the CHS when using too many questions.
  - Selecting single questions for the CHS during the import is now more intuitive.
  ## System Stability
  - Recent issues with missing OES and CHS scores are now resolved.
  ## Minor improvements
  - The UI now indicates if a respondent has been manually included when it was previously excluded.
  - Pay-as-you-go customers can now see their used credits in the Credit Overview.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-02-09" description="v1.4.6">
  ## CHS Import Assistant
  - Configuring the CHS for the manual import is now easier than ever before. Instead of selecting individual questions, you can now select full groups of questions that belong together.
  ## Downloading Survey Results
  - The export for larger surveys will now be sent via email to you. This way you don't have to wait on the page for the export to be ready.
  ## Minor improvements
  - The manual import loading indicator is now more intuitive.
  - Solved an issue where an error screen appeared after not using the app for a while.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-01-29" description="v1.4.5">
  ## New Attribute: Survey Description for CHS
  - You can now add a `surveyDescription` when submitting CHS data points to provide context about the survey’s purpose and intent. This increases the precision of the CHS. Find more information see the [Coherence Score docs](/knowledge-base/quality-checks/coherence-score) and the [API docs](/api-reference/endpoints/v3/addRespondent).
  ## Import Assistant
  - Selecting Grid Scores with more than 50 items is now prevented. Previously this led to errors in the upload.
  - Fixed an issue where ZIP codes lost leading zeros.
  ## Respondent Table
  - It is easier to change the cleaning status of a respondent.
  - Changing the cleaning status, deleting or recalculating respondents, does no longer reset your filter and sorting settings.
  - Improved loading indicator when loading or sorting larger tables.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-01-19" description="v1.4.4">
  ## Filtering Respondents by Attributes
  - In the Respondent Table, you can now filter the respondents by their attributes to e.g. view all respondents from a specific panel.
  - In the Data Visualization tab you can filter for specific attributes as well, giving you in depth insights into the data.
  ## Grid Quality Score
  - The overall Grid Quality Score now takes into account the number of items in the grid. This means longer grids have a higher impact on the overall score.
  ## Minor improvements
  - **Data Import**: Duplicate header rows are now consistently flagged as errors as soon as possible.
  - **Adding additional respondents**: It could rarely happen that no or only few respondents were added to the survey. This issue is now resolved.

  ## Decipher Import Assistant
  - The assistant’s output is now more accurate, requiring fewer manual adjustments to integrate with the ReDem API.

  - **Reliability**: - The manual data import process can now handle even larger files more reliably, reducing the likelihood of errors.
  - **Speed**: Individual steps in the import process have been optimized, significantly reducing upload times, especially for larger files.
  - **Bugfixes**: In some cases, an error message was displayed on the survey page after the import process completed instead of the progress bar. This issue has now been resolved.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-01-02" description="v1.4.2">
  ## Respondent Attributes: Support for your own custom attributes
  - You can now add any custom attributes to the respondent during the import process. These values will be available in the ReDem App and in the result export and can be used for further analysis of your data.
  ## Minor improvements
  - **Survey Overview**: The survey overview page is loading considerably faster now.
  - **Respondent Table**:The table pagination used to be buggy when switching between pages and page sizes. This issue is now resolved.

  ## Improved Respondent Table
  - **Column filtering**: You can now select which columns are displayed in the Respondent Table. This allows for a more focused view of the data.
  - **Header grouping**: The headers in the Respondent Table used to be hard to read as grouping of columns was not clear. Now columns that belong together have their own header group.
  - **Accessibility**: the readibility of several buttons in the Respondent Table is improved.

  ## Refined Excel and CSV Export
  - **Column filtering**: The Excel and CSV export mimic the column filtering in the Respondent Table. Only columns visible in the Respondent Table will be exported.
  - **Additional Excel sheets**: The Excel export now includes additional sheets for the OES, GQS, TS and CHS results. This makes post processesing the data easier.

  ## Time Score
  - Respondents that take a very long time to complete a survey are now scored lower. Previously the lowest Time Score for a respondent that took longer than the median was 50. The lowest Score is now 30.
  
  ## New BAS keystroke visualization
  - The BAS keystroke visualization has been completely revamped. You can skip the visualization during long pauses from respondents, see the total time spent typing and more.

  ## Survey Import
  - There are several minor improvements to the survey import process that make it feel smoother and more user-friendly.

  ## Transaction Overview
  - **Overview**: The Transaction Overview for Account Admins now shows a summary of the transactions for the account, as well as the total credits used and available.

  ## Export: Excel Format Support

  - **Excel export**: Results can now be exported in Excel (.xlsx) format in addition to CSV.
  - **Reliable data structure**: Excel exports avoid the common issue of CSV imports incorrectly identifying separator characters, which often results in broken columns.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-12-04" description="v1.3.3">
  ## File Import: OES Keywords Paste Support

  - **Cost Efficiency**: Credits are only deducted for the specific checks you select.
  - **Granular control**: Provides flexibility to fix data issues or apply new quality standards to a subset of respondents.
