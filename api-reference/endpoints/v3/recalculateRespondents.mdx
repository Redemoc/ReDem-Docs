This endpoint allows you to recalculate specific quality checks for a list of respondents within a survey. It is useful when you need to re-evaluate respondents with updated check configurations (e.g., enabling OES or Duplicate Detection) or if previous checks were skipped.

**Prerequisites:**
- The survey must have been created with API version `v3`.
- The feature must be enabled and the survey created after the feature release date (2025-12-02).
- You must provide valid `respondentIds` belonging to the specified `surveyName`.
- The number of `respondentIds` per request is limited to 100.
