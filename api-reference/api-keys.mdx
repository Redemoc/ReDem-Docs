API Keys in ReDem allow you to programmatically send and retrieve data, making it easy to integrate ReDem into your application or connect with other tools and services.

Users can create multiple API keys, each with specific permissions to control access, making integrations secure and flexible.

<Info>To create an API Key, you'll need a ReDem account. Donâ€™t have an account yet? <br/>Get started by [setting up your account](/account-setup).</Info>

## Create API Key
You can create an API key by following these steps:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Navigate to manage API Keys">
    <p> Once you are logged in to [ReDem Application](https://app.redem.io/), navigate to the API Keys section in your profile. </p>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    Click on the "Create API Key" button to generate a new key.
    
    Give your API key a meaningful name to help you identify its use later.
    
    Once youâ€™ve made an API key you should copy it and put it somewhere safe, as you will not be able to see it again once you navigate away.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go and connect with ReDem ðŸš€">
    <p>Great! Now that you have your API key, you can use it as a bearer token to securely send or retrieve data from ReDem in any API request.</p>
    ```plainApiKey_xxx
        Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_xxx
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Best practices for API key management:**

- Use separate keys for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Regularly rotate your keys to maintain security. We recommend every 90 days.
- If a key is compromised, delete it immediately and generate a new one.
