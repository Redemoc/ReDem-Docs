<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Request an API key">
    Contact us at support@redem.io to request an API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your request data">
    Ensure your data is formatted correctly according to the guidelines before sending it via the API. Below is a sample request object to help you structure your data properly.

    <p>For a synchronous response approach, the `synchronousResponse` field **must always be set to `true`**. This ensures you receive responses from ReDem in real time.</p>

    <p> Please format the request data as shown below:</p>

    ```javascript Example request body

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make an API request">
    <p> At the end of the survey, just before the respondent reaches the ‘complete’ state, submit an API request to ReDem including the respondent’s information and your API key.</p>

    ```javascript Example request (JavaScript)

      method: 'POST',
      headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: '{"respondentId":"RESP497770","projectName":"Global Vacation Insights 2024","dataPoints":[{"qualityCheck":"OES","dataPointId":"Q1","question":"Where did you spend your last vacation?","answer":"We were at Lake Garda in Italy","keywords":["Beach","Mountains","Lake","Museums","Europe","Asia","Destination"],"activateDuplicateDetection":true,"allowedLanguages":["en","de","it"]},{"qualityCheck":"TS","dataPointId":"durationQ1","duration":42670},{"qualityCheck":"GQS","dataPointId":"Q2","gridAnswersPattern":[7,8,9,1,3,5,2,5,9,6]},{"qualityCheck":"OES","dataPointId":"Q3","question":"What was the most memorable part of your last vacation?","answer":"Italian cuisine, especially pizza and fine wine.","keywords":["Cuisine","Food","Art","Adventure","History","Landscape","Culture"],"activateDuplicateDetection":true,"allowedLanguages":["en","de","it"]},{"qualityCheck":"TS","dataPointId":"durationQ3","duration":69720},{"qualityCheck":"CHS","dataPointId":"CHS_Question","interviewData":[{"question":"What mode of transport did you use?","answer":"Car"},{"question":"How many days did you stay?","answer":5},{"question":"Did you travel with family?","answer":"yes"},{"question":"What was your approximate total budget for the trip (in EUR)?","answer":1500},{"question":"What type of accommodation did you stay in?","answer":"Hotel"}]},{"qualityCheck":"GQS","dataPointId":"Q4","gridAnswersPattern":[2,1,4,3,5,2,3,1,1,1]},{"qualityCheck":"TS","dataPointId":"totalDuration","duration":256843}],"cleaningSettings":{"standardSettings":false,"CustomSettings":{"redemScore":60,"OES":{"score":30,"minimumAnswers":2,"categories":{"genericAnswers":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":2},"noInformation":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":2},"badLanguage":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":2},"nonsense":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"duplicateAnswer":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"duplicateRespondent":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"wrongTopic":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"wrongLanguage":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"copyPastAnswer":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1},"fakeAnswer":{"exclude":true,"minDataPoints":1}}},"CHS":{"score":20},"GQS":{"score":10,"minimumItems":15},"TS":{"score":20}}},"synchronousResponse":true}'

      .then(response => response.json())

    ```

  <Step title="Use the ReDem API response to trigger your next step (Cleaning)">
    <p>Retrieve the response from ReDem to trigger the next step in your workflow. If cleaning is enabled, low-quality responses will be excluded before reaching the complete state, while high-quality responses will be retained as complete.</p>
