<Info>To integrate ReDem with your survey tool, you'll need a ReDem account. <br /> Donâ€™t have an account yet? Get started by [setting up your account](/account-setup).</Info>

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Login and create an API key">
    Log in to your ReDem account and navigate to the account settings.
    Generate a new API key and copy it for use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your request data">
    Ensure your data is formatted correctly according to the guidelines before sending it via the API. Below is a sample request object to help you structure your data properly.

    <p>As a researcher, we **recommend adopting an synchronous response approach**. Therefore, keep the `synchronousResponse` field set to `true`. It allows you to get a response from ReDem in real time.</p>

    <p> Use your survey tool to scrape data and format the request data as follows:</p>

    ```javascript Example request body
    {
      "respondentId": "RESP497770", 
      "surveyName": "Global Vacation Insights 2024",
      "dataPoints": [ 
        {
          "qualityCheck": "OES",

          "dataPointId": "durationQ1", 
          "duration": 42670
        },
        // ... other data points ...
      ],
      "activateCleaning": true,
