**Welcome to the ReDem API documentation! 👋🏼**

This documentation provides a step-by-step approach to seamlessly integrating the ReDem API into your workflows and applications.

The backbone of our platform is the ReDem API. With our API you have direct access to every feature ReDem offers from real-time data access to smooth integration with your existing applications.

Best of all, since the ReDem Application runs entirely on this API, everything you can do in the app, you can also do through the API. **No limitations, just endless possibilities!**

## Integration Use Cases

The ReDem API supports two main integration use cases, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synchronous Response" icon="arrow-up-arrow-down" href="/api-reference/intro/synchronous-response">
    Receive an instant evaluation of the respondent's quality and seamlessly integrate this data into your workflow.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Asynchronous Response" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/api-reference/intro/asynchronous-response">
    Process respondent quality evaluations in the background and retrieve results later using the Get Respondent/s endpoints.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Versioning

ReDem's API uses versioned endpoints to ensure backward compatibility while introducing new features. Currently, three API versions are available:

- **v1**: Legacy endpoints (deprecated)
- **v2**: Introduced consistent CHS question IDs
- **v3**: Enhanced OES with improved categories and effort scale (recommended)

<Warning>
**Important:** You cannot upgrade the API version for a survey that is currently running. Each survey is permanently tied to the API version it was created with. To use a newer API version, you must create a new survey with the updated endpoints.
</Warning>

For detailed migration instructions, see the [API Version Migration Guide](/api-reference/others/migration-guide).

## Base URL

ReDem's API is built on REST principles following the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard as much as possible.  To ensure data security, it operates exclusively over HTTPS, encrypting all interactions. Unencrypted HTTP connections are not supported, safeguarding your data by default.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```plainApiKey_xxx
https://api.redem.io/
```

Versioned endpoints use the format: `https://api.redem.io/v3/addRespondent`.

<Note>ReDem's API is currently in public beta and is subject to change. However, we will do our best to keep breaking changes to a minimum. </Note>
