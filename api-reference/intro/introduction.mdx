**Welcome to the ReDem API documentation! üëãüèº**

This documentation provides a step-by-step approach to seamlessly integrating the ReDem API into your workflows and applications.

The backbone of our platform is the ReDem API. With our API you have direct access to every feature ReDem offers from real-time data access to smooth integration with your existing applications.

Best of all, since the ReDem Application runs entirely on this API, everything you can do in the app, you can also do through the API. **No limitations, just endless possibilities!**

## Integration Use Cases

The ReDem API supports two main integration use cases, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synchronous Response" icon="arrow-up-arrow-down" href="/api-reference/intro/synchronous-response">
    Receive an instant evaluation of the respondent‚Äôs quality and seamlessly integrate this data into your workflow.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Asynchronous Response" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/api-reference/intro/asynchronous-response">
    Process respondent quality evaluations in the background and retrieve results later using the Get Respondent/s endpoints.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Base URL

ReDem‚Äôs API is built on REST principles following the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard as much as possible.  To ensure data security, it operates exclusively over HTTPS, encrypting all interactions. Unencrypted HTTP connections are not supported, safeguarding your data by default.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```plainApiKey_xxx
https://api.redem.io/
```

<Note>ReDem‚Äôs API is currently in public beta and is subject to change. However, we will do our best to keep breaking changes to a minimum. </Note>
