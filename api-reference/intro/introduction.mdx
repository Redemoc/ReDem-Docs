**Welcome to the ReDem API documentation! üëãüèº** 

This documentation provides a set-by-step guide to help you unlock the full potential of ReDem by seamlessly integrating the ReDem API into your workflows and applications.

The backbone of our platform is the ReDem API. With our API you have direct access to every feature ReDem offers from real-time data access to smooth integration with your existing applications.

Best of all, since the ReDem Application runs entirely on this API, everything you can do in the app, you can also do through the API. **No limitations, just endless possibilities!**

## Integration Use Cases
The ReDem API supports two main integration use cases, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow:

## Base URL
ReDem‚Äôs API is built on REST principles following the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard as much as possible.  For your data‚Äôs security, it operates exclusively over HTTPS, so you can trust that all interactions are encrypted. Unencrypted HTTP connections aren‚Äôt supported, keeping your data safe by default.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:
```plainApiKey_xxx
https://live-api.redem.io/
```


<Note>ReDem‚Äôs API is currently in public beta and is subject to change. However, we will do our best to keep breaking changes to a minimum. </Note>

If you have any questions or need assistance, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@redem.io. We‚Äôre here to help you get the most out of ReDem!
