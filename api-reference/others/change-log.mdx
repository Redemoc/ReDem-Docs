  ## API endpoint updates

  The <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /addRespondent </code> endpoint has been updated to rename parameters in the cleaning settings, changing from **camelCase to UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE** formatting.

  The following is an example of the new cleaning settings object:
  ```javascript
    "redemScore": 60,
    "OES": {
      "activate": true,
      "score": 60,
      "minDataPoints":2,
      "categories": {
        "GENERIC_ANSWER": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
        "NO_INFORMATION": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":3},
        // ... other categories ...
      }
    },
    "CHS": {"activate": true,"score": 50},
    "GQS": {"activate": true,"score": 40, "minDataPoints":2},
    "TS": {"activate": true,"score": 20},
    "BAS": {
      "activate": true,
      "score": 60, 
      "minDataPoints":2,
      "categories": {
        "UNNATURAL_TYPING": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
        "COPY_AND_PASTE": {"activate": true, "minDataPoints":2},
      }
    }
  ```

  ## API endpoint updates

  The following API endpoint changes have been implemented to improve consistency and standardization:

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}> POST /respondent/add </code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /addRespondent </code> <br />

  * The `interactionData` field within `dataPoints` â†’ `qualityCheck: BAS` has been modified to support additional interaction types. Now, it has been expanded to include both `KEYSTROKE` and `COPYANDPASTE` interactions, enhancing tracking capabilities.

  * Enhanced the **request body cleaning settings** by allowing **activate/deactivate** options for each quality check and enhanced **cleaning settings** by introducing **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** along with its categories.

  * Renamed the **Fake Answer** category in **Open-Ended Score (OES)** to **AI-Generated Answer**.

  * We have **enhanced** the response structure by adding a field to retrieve **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** results.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}> GET /respondent/getRespondent </code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /getRespondent </code> <br />

  * Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` and `respondentId` as a path parameters. Now we pass it in the request body.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}> GET /respondent/getAllRespondents </code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /getAllRespondents </code> <br />

  * Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` as a path parameter. Now we pass it in the request body.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}> GET /survey/stop </code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /stopSurvey</code> <br />

  * Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` as a path parameter. Now we pass it in the request body.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}> GET /respondent/estimation </code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}> POST /creditCalculation </code> <br />

  * Introduced a new variable, **`BASDataPoints`**, to specify the number of BAS data points required for credit calculation when evaluating a respondent.

  * Rename the variable **`CHSInterviews`** to **`CHSAnswers`** in the request body.

  * We have introduced a new response structure for the `POST /creditCalculation` endpoint, improving clarity by renaming several fields for better self-explanatory representation.

  ## Enhanced the quality checks by introducing Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)

  We have enhanced the quality checks by introducing **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** to evaluate the respondent's behavior and provide a score and categories based on the behavior.

  * Removed the **Copy-Paste** category from **Open-Ended Score (OES)** and incorporated it under **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)**.

  ## Streamlined the API response in error cases

  When a request fails due to invalid input or other errors, the all API returns a **400 Bad Request** status code. The response includes a descriptive `message` explaining the issue and an `error` object containing additional details to aid in diagnosing and resolving the problem.
