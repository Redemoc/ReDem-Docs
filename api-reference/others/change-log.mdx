<Update label="2025-03-05" description="Unversioned changes">
  ## API endpoint updates
  The following API endpoint changes have been implemented to improve consistency and standardization:

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}>POST /respondent/add</code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}>POST /addRespondent</code> <br/>
  - The `interactionData` field within `dataPoints` â†’ `qualityCheck: BAS` has been modified to support additional interaction types. Now, it has been expanded to include both `KEYSTROKE` and `COPYANDPASTE` interactions, enhancing tracking capabilities.
  - Enhanced the **request body cleaning settings** by allowing **activate/deactivate** options for each quality check and enhanced **cleaning settings** by introducing **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** along with its categories.
  - Renamed the **Fake Answer** category in **Open-Ended Score (OES)** to **AI-Generated Answer**.
  - We have **enhanced** the response structure by adding a field to retrieve **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** results.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}>GET /respondent/getRespondent</code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}>POST /getRespondent</code> <br/>
  - Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` and `respondentId` as a path parameters. Now we pass it in the request body. 
  
  <code style={{ color: "red" }}>GET /respondent/getAllRespondents</code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}>POST /getAllRespondents</code> <br/>
  - Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` as a path parameter. Now we pass it in the request body.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}>GET /survey/stop</code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}>POST /stopSurvey</code> <br/>
  - Previously with `GET` request we pass the `surveyName` as a path parameter. Now we pass it in the request body.

  <code style={{ color: "red" }}>GET /respondent/estimation</code> â†’ <code style={{ color: "green" }}>POST /creditCalculation</code> <br/>
  - Introduced a new variable, **`BASDataPoints`**, to specify the number of BAS data points required for credit calculation when evaluating a respondent.
  - Rename the variable **`CHSInterviews`** to **`CHSAnswers`** in the request body.
  - We have introduced a new response structure for the `POST /creditCalculation` endpoint, improving clarity by renaming several fields for better self-explanatory representation.

  ## Enhanced the quality checks by introducing Behavior Analysis Score (BAS)
  We have enhanced the quality checks by introducing **Behavior Analysis Score (BAS)** to evaluate the respondent's behavior and provide a score and categories based on the behavior.
  - Removed the **Copy-Paste** category from **Open-Ended Score (OES)** and incorporated it under **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)**.

  ## Streamlined the API response in error cases
  When a request fails due to invalid input or other errors, the all API returns a **400 Bad Request** status code. The response includes a descriptive `message` explaining the issue and an `error` object containing additional details to aid in diagnosing and resolving the problem.
