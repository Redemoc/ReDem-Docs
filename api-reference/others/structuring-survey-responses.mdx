This guide explains how to format your survey data into structured data points suitable for submission to the <code>addRespondent</code> endpoint of the ReDem API.

### Preparing survey responses for CHS (Coherence Score) data point
For each CHS data point, all question–answer pairs must be included as separate objects within the <code>interviewData</code> array. Each object should contain both a <code>question</code> (as a string) and an <code>answer</code> (as a string or number) to ensure compatibility with the <code>addRespondent</code> endpoint.

- **Single-select questions** <br />
Single-select questions (radio buttons, dropdowns, yes/no, Likert scale, NPS, etc.) produce one answer value.

    Transform the question and answer into a structured object with the following format:

```javascript Example interviewData objects for a single-select question
// Dropdown question
{
    "question": "Which of the following protein sources do you enjoy the most?",
    "answer": "Beef"
}

// Radio button question
{
    "question": "In a typical week, how frequently do you eat red meat (e.g., beef, pork)?",
    "answer": "3–5 times per week"
}

// Yes/No question
{
    "question": "Do you like Fish or seafood?",
    "answer": "No"
}

// Likert scale question
{
    "question": "How much do you enjoy eating street food?",
    "answer": "Not at all"
}

// NPS question
{
    "question": "How likely are you to recommend our food delivery service to a friend or colleague",
    "answer": 8
}
```

- **Multi-select questions** <br />
Multi-select questions (checkboxes) produce a zero, one or many answer values.

    Transform the question and answer into a structured object with the following format:

    - Add every option label to the question so that downstream systems can reconstruct the full context.
    - Concatenate all selected options in the answer field, separated by comma. 
    - If no options are selected, set the answer to the literal string “None of those”.

```javascript Example interviewData objects for a multi-select question
// if the respondet selected one option
{
  "question": "Which of these dietary preferences or restrictions apply to you? (Select all that apply)",
  "answer": "Vegetarian"
}


// if the respondet selected more than one option
{
    "question": "Which of the following foods do you eat regularly? (You may select more than one.) - Chicken, Cheese, Bacon or sausage, Eggs, Fish or seafood, Plant-based meat substitutes (e.g., tofu, tempeh), Milk or dairy products, Fruits, Leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, kale)",
    "answer": "Cheese, Eggs"
}


// if the respondet did not select any of the options
{
    "question": "Which of the following fast foods brands do you consume more? - McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Subway, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, Domino's, Papa John's",
    "answer": "None of those"
}
```

- **Open-ended questions** <br />
Open-ended questions produce a free text or numeric answer value.

```javascript Example interviewData object for an open-ended question
{
    "question": "Can you describe your typical eating habits during the week?",
    "answer": "I usually eat home-cooked meals with lots of vegetables and lean meats. I occasionally eat out on weekends, mostly opting for Asian or Mediterranean dishes. I try to avoid sugary snacks and drink plenty of water throughout the day."
}
```

- **Grid (matrix) questions** <br />
Grid/matrix questions contain a stem plus multiple row items that share the same answer scale.

    Transform the grid/matrix stem, row labels and answer scale into a structured object with the following format:

    - Emit one object per row item so that each cell becomes its own data point
    - Concatenate the stem and the row label, separated by -, to form the question.
    - Keep the selected scale label as the answer.

```javascript Example interviewData object for a grid/matrix question
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Red meat (e.g., beef, pork)",
    "answer": "3–5 times per week"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Fish or seafood",
    "answer": "Several times per day"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Poultry (e.g., chicken, turkey)",
    "answer": "1–2 times per week"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Dairy products (e.g., milk, cheese, yogurt)",
    "answer": "Daily"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Eggs",
    "answer": "3–5 times per week"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Legumes (e.g., beans, lentils, chickpeas)",
    "answer": "1–2 times per week"
},
{
    "question": "Please indicate how often you usually eat the following types of food. Think about a normal week. - Grains (e.g., rice, pasta, bread)",
    "answer": "Daily"
}
```
