ReDem API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "status": "JOB_FAILED",
        "code": "400",
        "message": "VALIDATION_ERROR"
    }
}
```

## Error Codes
If you receive an error code as part of an API call, this is where you can look up what it means

### <code> bad_request </code>
- **code:** 400
- **Problem:** The request is malformed, either missing required fields, using wrong datatypes, or being syntactically incorrect.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure it is properly formatted.

### <code> unauthorized </code>
- **code:** 401
- **Problem:** The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
- **Solution:** Make sure you are using the correct API key or access token.

### <code> forbidden </code>
- **code:** 403
- **Problem:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper permission.
- **Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### <code> not_found </code>
- **code:** 404

- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure the resource exists.
