    "message": "Respondent Evaluated successfully",
    "results": {
        "status": "JOB_COMPLETED",
        "respondentQuality": {
            "isExcluded": true,
            "reasonsForExclusion": [
                "Open Ended Score Threshold",
                "Coherence Score Threshold"
            ],
            "redemScore": 85,
           // ... rest of the response object ...
        }
    }
}
```
