## Rate Limits & Performance Considerations
Rate limits are enforced **per API key** to protect platform stability and ensure fair usage across clients.

### Endpoint-specific limits

#### `addRespondent`
- **Standard API keys**: **600 requests / minute**
- **Premium API keys**: **1200 requests / minute**

#### All other endpoints (excluding `addRespondent`)
- **1200 requests / minute** per API key

⭕ **Please note:** If you exceed the configured limits, requests may be temporarily rejected (HTTP `429`).

**🔦 Tip:** <br/>
For clients with specific performance requirements or higher scalability needs, contact `info@redem.io` to explore the **Dedicated Tier**.
