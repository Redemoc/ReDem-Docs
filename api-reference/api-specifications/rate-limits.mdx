## Rate Limits & Performance Considerations
The API is currently optimized for best performance, with a **response time of 3â€“5 seconds at a maximum rate of 1 request per second**, and up to **5 concurrent requests allowed within any rolling 5-second window**. These limits apply collectively to all clients on the ReDem Shared Tier. This reflects the current performance state, which is continuously being improved. We will keep this section updated as further optimizations are made.

â­• **Please note:** The API can also handle increased request volumes; however, response times may be longer due to shared resource usage, following a first-come, first-served model.


**ðŸ”¦ Tip:** <br/>
For clients with specific performance requirements or higher scalability needs, we recommend contacting info@redem.io to explore the **Dedicated Tier**. This tier offers greater flexibility and allows you to scale the infrastructure to meet your critical workload demands with ReDem.
