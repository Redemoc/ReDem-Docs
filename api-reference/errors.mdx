ReDem API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "not_found",
        "message": "The requested resource was not found."
    }
}
```

## Error Codes
If you receive an error code as part of an API call, this is where you can look up what it means

### <code> bad_request </code>
- **Status:** 400
- **Problem:** The request is malformed, either missing required fields, using wrong datatypes, or being syntactically incorrect.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure it is properly formatted.

### <code> unauthorized </code>
- **Status:** 401
- **Problem:** The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
- **Solution:** Make sure you are using the correct API key or access token.

### <code> forbidden </code>
- **Status:** 403
- **Problem:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper permission.
- **Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### <code> not_found </code>
- **Status:** 404
- **Problem:** The server has not found anything matching the request URI.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure the resource exists.
