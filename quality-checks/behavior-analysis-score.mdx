## What is the Behavioral Analytics Score?

The **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** is a quality score designed to evaluate user typing patterns. It analyzes various aspects of typing behavior to distinguish between natural human typing and potentially automated or artificial inputs.

With advancements in AI, respondents can generate answers using AI bots, computer-assisted inputs, automated scripts, or other artificial inputs. With this innovative approach, ReDem can identify more instances of survey fraud than ever before, enhancing data reliability and authenticity.

## How does the Behavioral Analytics Score work?

The Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS) evaluates typing behavior by **analyzing each keystroke, the text entered, and the time taken for each input.** It then compares these **timing patterns with the text structure and the standard deviation** of keystroke intervals to detect anomalies, potentially automated or artificial inputs. Along with this, BAS also detects **copy-and-paste** actions, identifying responses that bypass natural typing patterns.

### Different typing patterns

**Natural Human Typing** <br />
Involves progressive character-by-character input with natural pauses between words and a varying yet consistent rhythm. For example, it reflects regular sentence formation with normal variations in typing speed.

**Low-Effort Human Typing** <br />
Still classified as natural typing but may exhibit less consistent patterns while maintaining human-like variability in timing.

**Auto-Complete Enhanced Typing** <br />
Combines manual input with auto-complete suggestions, resulting in distinct patterns of rapid text insertion. If it falls within acceptable human like typing patterns.

**Copy-Paste Typing** <br />
Involves directly inserting text without keystroke activity, bypassing natural typing patterns. This behavior is flagged as non-human input, as it lacks the expected variations in speed, rhythm, and pauses associated with manual typing.

**Unnatural Typing** <br />
Exhibits irregular keystroke patterns, such as highly inconsistent timing, repetitive sequences, or extremely fast inputs that deviate from human behavior. This may indicate automated responses, AI-assisted typing, or scripted entries, making it a strong indicator of non-human activity.

## How does ReDem classify responses?

The system uses **AI and custom algorithms** to classify typing behavior into different categories.

### Categories

* **Natural**: Indicates genuine human typing patterns

* **Unnatural**: Indicates automated / scripted input from bots / AI systems etc.

* **Copy-paste**: Detects when content is primarily copied and pasted.

### Scoring system

The **Behavioral Analytics Score (BAS)** uses a structured scoring system to evaluate the quality of typing behavior. The scoring system is defined as follows:

* The **BAS score ranges from 0 to 100**

* **Higher scores `(>50)`** indicate more **natural** typing patterns.

* **Lower scores `(<50)`** suggest **unnatural** typing behavior, with lower scores increasing the likelihood of non-human input.

* A **score of 0** is assigned when **copy-paste** behavior is detected.
