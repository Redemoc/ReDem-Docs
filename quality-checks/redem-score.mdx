## 360-degree data quality assessment

At the core of ReDem lies a 360-degree approach, enabling us to analyze interviews from every possible perspective. Each interview undergoes rigorous quality checks, culminating in the ReDem Score (R-Score). This score integrates all relevant quality criteria, offering a transparent and objective assessment of data quality in survey responses. With ReDem, every questionnaire becomes a sophisticated web of safeguards, making it nearly impossible for fraudsters to go undetected.
